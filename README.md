# A Mars settlement and exploration game

You just made it to Mars after a long trip from Earth.
Your job is to get the settlement ready for the future arrivals.

## Goal of the game

To become a self-sustaining settlement on Mars and eventually terraforming Mars.
This means achieving production of things like:
- Water
- Food
- Rocket fuel
- Spare parts
- Terraforming equipment


## Game ideas

Focus on the logistics, not the people.

- Mines to mine material from Mars.
- Factories to assemble materials and make various parts and machines.
- Greenhouses to make food. Factories can make fake meat.
- Spaceport for departures and arrivals from Earth. Factory to make rocket fuel.
- Recycling center to recycle human waste for water and soil.

Logistic automation:
- Inspired by Factorio but at a higher level. You don't make assembling lines,
  you just transport materials to different places.
- Robots and vehicles to automate transfer of supplies.
